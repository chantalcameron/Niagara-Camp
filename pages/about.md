## About the Collection

After confederation a military reserve for the defence of Canada was established in Niagara.  Camp Niagara in Niagara-on-the-Lake was used as a summer training grounds for infantry, cavalry, and artillery.  At the start of World War I in 1914 the Camp was used to train the Second Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In 1917 the Camp was used to train a group of expatriate Poles and Polish Americans who were recruited to serve in the war. Over 22, 000 volunteers of the Polish diaspora from across Canada and the United States trained at Camp Niagara, known to them as Camp Kosciuszko.
