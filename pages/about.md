## About the Collection

After confederation a military reserve for the defence of Canada was established in Niagara.  Camp Niagara in Niagara-on-the-Lake was used as a summer training grounds for infantry, cavalry, and artillery.  At the start of World War I in 1914 the Camp was used to train the Second Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. In 1917 the Camp was used to train a group of expatriate Poles and Polish Americans who were recruited to serve in the war. Over 22, 000 volunteers of the Polish diaspora from across Canada and the United States trained at Camp Niagara, known to them as Camp Kosciuszko.

Postcards of Niagara Camp were common.  Trainees at the camp would keep them as a souvenir, or write to their family and friends and provide them with a glimpse of their surroundings.  One such postcard reads "Here is where we live.  Are getting along fine.  Is...better than we thought it was.  We are learning something that is of some good to us.  Will write later.  My hand is shaky so my writing is frightful.  From Edwin".
